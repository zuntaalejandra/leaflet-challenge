# Earthquake Visualization based on JSON from The United States Geological Info - USGS  


The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

See the webpage of USGS services.

This webpage implements a world map to visualize all the earthquakes from the Past 7 Days

# How data is obtained

Use of the next  URL (in JSON format) is used to   pull in the data. 

https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson

The following image is a sampling of earthquake data in JSON format:

#imageJSON

# Special considerations

The JSON data reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes are showed in larger circles, and earthquakes with greater depth appears darker in color.
